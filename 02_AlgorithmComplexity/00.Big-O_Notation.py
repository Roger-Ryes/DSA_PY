# BIG-O NOTATION
# The Big-O notation is at its heart a mathematical notation, used to compare the rate of convergence of functions.
# Big-O notation: is used in algorithm complexity analysis : functions defined on the naturals, that have non-zero values, and the case
#                 of n growing to infinity.
# Big-O help compare and classify functions by their speed of convergence.
# 
# We are interested in the number of operations that an algorithm performs. This is called time complexity. 
# In this model, we consider that each basic operation takes a fixed amount of time, and we count the number of such
# operations. We can usually express this number as a function of the size of the input, which we call "n".
# When we speak about a "O(n^2) algorithm", we mean that the number of operations it performs. This says that our algorithm is
# approximately as fast as an algorithm that would do a number of operations equal to the square of the size of its
# input, or faster. 
# 
# When counting operations, we usually consider the worst case: for instance if we have a loop that can run at most n 
# times and that contains 5 operations, the number of operations we count is 5n
